## RoboAdvisor Discovery - Q3 Scoping

This document outlines the initial scope for the RoboAdvisor Discovery Project, focusing on developing a tool to help consumers understand their life insurance needs. The core idea is a calculator-style widget that addresses fundamental questions:

*   Do I need life insurance?
*   How much do I need?
*   How long do I need it for?
*   What type of insurance do I need (term vs. permanent)?

The project emphasizes leveraging existing Everly expertise and data, along with publicly available resources, to demonstrate technical capabilities. A simple, functional demo is prioritized over sophisticated interfaces or extensive UX research at this stage. Key out-of-scope items include user experience and design optimization, transaction capabilities, advanced product recommendations, extensive market research, and detailed governance processes.

The rationale behind this scope is alignment with Everly's mission to inform consumers, utilization of existing expertise, a practical approach to building a functional widget, and clear success metrics centered on guiding users through basic insurance questions and providing informative responses.

## RoboAdvisor Vision

This document presents a broader, long-term vision for the RoboAdvisor, conceptualizing it as an intelligent Copilot or "Agent AI" operating across three critical stages:

1.  **Discovery:** Querying and surfacing product details, use cases, and recommendations tailored to a user's financial profile.
2.  **Design:** Personalization layer leveraging individual data to craft bespoke recommendations, including visualizing cash value growth scenarios.
3.  **Engagement:** Policy management and ongoing queries, with the potential to evolve from agent assistance to autonomous consumer experiences.

The practical roadmap is phased:

*   **Phase 1 (2025): Enhancing Sales Efficiency for Licensed Agents** - Empowering agents with instant access to curated policy information.
*   **Phase 2 (2026): Expanding Personalization in Design** - Integrating product illustration engines with LLMs for graphical data outputs and dynamic client-friendly illustrations.
*   **Phase 3 (2027+): Consumer Autonomy & Industry Disruption** - Evolving to a consumer-facing tool for direct interaction with financial advisory portfolios.

A significant focus is placed on **Integration at JPMorgan Scale**, highlighting how the robo-advisor could transform JPMorgan's workflows by:

*   **Advisor Confidence:** Enabling bankers and financial planners to deliver smart life insurance recommendations directly.
*   **Data Crawling to Trigger Conversations:** Proactively flagging unmet insurance needs based on existing financial data.
*   **Monetization Opportunities:** Expanding white-label agentic tools to other carriers.

Challenges and guardrails include ensuring accuracy (eliminating hallucination risks), building consumer trust, and navigating data privacy and compliance. The conclusion emphasizes the transformative potential of the robo-advisor to disrupt the industry by embedding AI across the financial planning spectrum.
